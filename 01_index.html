                <p><span>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</span> (/ˈɑːbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ (About this soundlisten); 15
                    October 1931 – 27
                    July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to
                    2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace
                    engineering. He
                    spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research
                    and
                    Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately
                    involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus
                    came
                    to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and
                    launch
                    vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role
                    in
                    India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in
                    1974.
